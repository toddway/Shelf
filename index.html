    <a href="files/coverage/html/index.html">JaCoCo Coverage Report</a><br/>
    JaCoCo helps you visually analyze test coverage.
        Lines coverage reflects the amount of code that has been exercised based on the number of Java byte code instructions called by the tests.
        Branches coverage shows the percent of exercised branches in the code – typically related to if/else and switch statements.
        Cyclomatic complexity reflects the complexity of code by giving the number of paths needed to cover all the possible paths in a code through linear combination.
        See the current configuration (included and excluded file patterns) in the repository at this path: ./shelf/checks.gradle
